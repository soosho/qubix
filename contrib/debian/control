Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Qubix is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant, private
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Qubix uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Qubix Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, qubixd, and the CLI tool
 qubix-cli to interact with the daemon.

Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool
 Qubix is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant, private
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Qubix uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Qubix Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

 This package provides qubix-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a qubix daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
